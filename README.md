# Next.js Prop Drilling Issue

This repository demonstrates a common issue in Next.js applications: prop drilling.  The issue arises when passing data through multiple layers of components. This can lead to code that is harder to maintain and understand.  

## Problem

The provided `bug.js` file illustrates how passing props through multiple components makes the code unnecessarily complex and challenging to maintain.

## Solution

The `bugSolution.js` file demonstrates a cleaner approach using Context API to handle state management effectively across components. This improves code readability and maintainability, resolving the prop drilling issue.
